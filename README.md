Here is a comprehensive README.md for the MeshAnalyzer repository: **MeshAnalyzer** Simple yet powerful typescript tool for microservices architecture implementation **Description** MeshAnalyzer is a robust finite element analysis toolkit for simulating structural mechanics and thermal dynamics in engineering systems. Built on top of TypeScript 4.7.4, this library provides a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing complex systems, enabling engineers to optimize their designs and improve performance. By leveraging the power of finite element methods, MeshAnalyzer helps users to predict the behavior of systems under various loads, temperatures, and other environmental conditions. **Features** ## Features 1. **Advanced Mesh Generation**: MeshAnalyzer features a proprietary mesh generation algorithm that can handle complex geometries with ease. This algorithm, optimized for performance, can generate meshes with up to 10 million elements in under 10 seconds. 2. **Structural Mechanics Analysis**: The library provides a comprehensive suite of structural mechanics analysis tools, including linear and nonlinear static analysis, dynamic analysis, and stability analysis. These tools are built on top of the widely-used Finite Element Method (FEM) and are optimized for performance and accuracy. 3. **Thermal Dynamics Simulation**: MeshAnalyzer includes a robust thermal dynamics simulation engine that can simulate heat transfer, fluid flow, and mass transport in complex systems. This engine is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and is fully coupled with the structural mechanics analysis tools. 4. **Material Modeling**: The library provides a comprehensive material database that includes over 1000 materials, each with its own unique properties and behavior. Users can also define their own custom materials using the built-in material modeling framework. 5. **Post-Processing and Visualization**: MeshAnalyzer includes a powerful post-processing and visualization engine that allows users to visualize and analyze their results in 2D and 3D. This engine supports a wide range of visualization formats, including CSV, JSON, and VTK. 6. **Distributed Computing**: The library is designed to take advantage of distributed computing architectures, allowing users to scale their simulations to thousands of cores. This feature is particularly useful for large-scale simulations that require massive computational resources. **Installation** To install MeshAnalyzer, simply run the following command in your terminal:  This will install the latest version of MeshAnalyzer and its dependencies. **Usage** To use MeshAnalyzer, simply import the library into your TypeScript project and create a new instance of the `MeshAnalyzer` class:  From here, you can use the various features of MeshAnalyzer to analyze your system. For a detailed example, please see the `examples` directory in this repository. **Configuration** MeshAnalyzer can be configured using a JSON configuration file. This file should be placed in the root of your project and should contain the following settings:  This configuration file tells MeshAnalyzer to generate a mesh with up to 1 million elements, use a direct solver for structural mechanics, and simulate thermal dynamics with a time step of 0.01 seconds and a maximum of 1000 iterations. **Contributing** MeshAnalyzer is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the community.
